## RNA sequencing of ALS-mutant FUS mouse

In collaboration with the Storkebaum lab, mRNA from neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was studied. The muscle nuclei were studied on single-cell (actually single-nucleus) level, the same samples were studied also as bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, mRNA from synaptosomes, distal parts of neuronal axon terminals, was analysed as well.
