## RNA sequencing of ALS-mutant FUS mouse

In collaboration with the Storkebaum lab, mRNA from neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was studied.

In this project, the muscle nuclei were studied in three independent experiments:
  - on single-cell (actually single-nucleus) level,
  - the same genotypes were also studied as bulk RNA-seq data.
  - mRNA from synaptosomes - the distal parts of neuronal axon terminals.

Protocols, hypothesis, and results regarding this project can be found in PhD Thesis: _Anne R. Wienand: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Neuromuscular Dysfunction in ALS and CMT. 2024_
